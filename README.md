Project 1: Building the following chips given Nand gate:
1. Not
2. And
3. Or
4. Xor
5. Mux
6. DMux
7. Not16
8. And16
9. Or16
10. Mux16
11. Or8Way
12. Mux4Way16
13. Mux8Way16
14. DMux4Way
15. DMux8Way


Project 2: Building the following chips using gates/chips and mux/demux built in previous project:
1. HalfAdder
2. FullAdder
3. Add16
4. Inc16
5. ALU

FullAdder is implemented without carry-forward, as recommended, but I do want to come back later and implement a carry forward version of it as well.
