Project 1: Building the following chips given Nand gate
    Nand (given)
    Not
    And
    Or
    Xor
    Mux
    DMux
    Not16
    And16
    Or16
    Mux16
    Or8Way
    Mux4Way16
    Mux8Way16
    DMux4Way
    DMux8Way


Project 2: Building the following chips using gates/chips and mux/demux built in previous project:
    HalfAdder
    FullAdder
    Add16
    Inc16
    ALU

FullAdder is implemented without carry-forward, as recommended, but I do want to come back later and implement a carry forward version of it as well.
